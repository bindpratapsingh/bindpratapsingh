### 🔭 Current Research & Engineering

I specialize in **optimizing system performance** and applying **intelligence** to critical infrastructure.

#### 🚦 [The Route Cause](https://github.com/bindpratapsingh/The_Route_Cause) (Smart City Infrastructure)
* **Problem:** Static traffic signals fail to handle surges or emergency vehicles.
* **Solution:** Engineered a **3-Tier Intelligent Architecture** acting as Eyes (Perception), Brain (Decision), and Supervisor (Guardian).
* **Tech:** Utilized **YOLOv8** for density detection and a **Q-Learning Agent** for signal timing.
* **Key Feature:** The "Guardian Layer" enforces safety rules, granting immediate **preemption for emergency vehicles** and preventing starvation.

#### ⚡ [AI-PoT Scheduler](https://github.com/bindpratapsingh/AI-PoT) (Distributed Systems)
* **Goal:** Reducing **P99 (Tail) Latency** in heterogeneous clusters where classical Power-of-Two choices fail.
* **Implementation:** Built a simulation using **MPI (OpenMPI)** to model straggler nodes and heavy-tailed "elephant" workloads.
* **Innovation:** Integrated an O(1) inference **Linear Regression model** to predict task costs, outperforming classic schedulers in high-load scenarios.

#### 📦 [Process Migration Engine](https://github.com/bindpratapsingh/AI-Assisted-Process-Migration-for-Optimized-Load-Balancing) (Load Balancing)
* **Metric:** Orchestrated proactive container migrations using **CRIU** and **Docker**.
* **Result:** Improved load distribution by 25% with predictive ML models.
