### 🔭 Current Research & Engineering

I specialize in **optimizing tail latency** in distributed environments and applying **Reinforcement Learning** to critical infrastructure.

#### 🚦 The Route Cause (Smart City Infrastructure)
* **Problem:** Static traffic signals fail to handle surges or emergency vehicles.
* **Solution:** Engineered a **3-Tier Intelligent Architecture** acting as Eyes (Perception), Brain (Decision), and Supervisor (Guardian).
* [cite_start]**Tech:** Utilized **YOLOv8** for density detection and a **Q-Learning Agent** for signal timing[cite: 8].
* **Key Feature:** The "Guardian Layer" enforces safety rules, granting immediate **preemption for emergency vehicles** and preventing starvation.

#### ⚡ AI-PoT Scheduler (Distributed Systems)
* [cite_start]**Goal:** Reducing **P99 (Tail) Latency** in heterogeneous clusters where classical Power-of-Two choices fail[cite: 22].
* [cite_start]**Implementation:** Built a simulation using **MPI (OpenMPI)** to model straggler nodes and heavy-tailed "elephant" workloads[cite: 20].
* **Innovation:** Integrated an O(1) inference **Linear Regression model** to predict task costs, outperforming classic schedulers in high-load scenarios.

#### 📦 Process Migration Engine (Load Balancing)
* [cite_start]**Metric:** Orchestrated proactive container migrations using **CRIU** and **Docker**[cite: 24].
* [cite_start]**Result:** Improved load distribution by 25% with predictive ML models[cite: 28].
